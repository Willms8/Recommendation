      <h2>BUDGETING</h2>
      **Lets figure out some ways to save more money!**
      <dl>
        <dt><u>Income:</u></dt>
        <dd>This part of the calculator varies on each person. We want to adjest spending habits based on your income.</dd></br>
        <dt><u>Housing: </u></dt>
        <dd>Depending on the area that you live in, the rent price based on the Zipcode of your area could be extremely high, such as Seattle, California, New York etc. You can look at other housing prices to save a few hundreds dollars, which can accumilate to a lot of savings.</dd></br>
        <dt><u>Groceries: </u></dt>
        <dd>Groceries are something that people can work around to save a tremendous amount of money. Depending on your financial position currently, it is wise to consider only buying necessary foods, and start cooking at home. Try to not eat out, buy unecessary snacks, and try to prevent any extra spendings.</dd></br>
        <dt><u>Transportation: </u></dt>
        <dd>Depending on your situation, this part depends on the fuel economy of your vehicle, or public transportation rates. If you want to start saving a lot of money, consider buying a more fuel efficient vehicle, especially considering that gas prices are sky-rocketing. For public transportation, usually that is a great way to save money, because the cost is usually low.</dd></br>
        <dt><u>Subscriptions: </u></dt>
        <dd>For any subscriptions, you should be first asking yourself, "Do I need this?", and consider looking over all of your subscriptions and eliminating anything that you do not need. Subscriptions can seem low at first, but by the time you signed up for five subscriptions, you could be paying above $50 a month. If you want to save money, consider eliminating some subscriptions.</dd></br>
        <dt><u>Savings: </u></dt>
        <dd>If you are focused on spending money on the other areas, you probably do not have any money left to put into your savings account. Saving even 10ï¼… of your income can have a drastic change, allowing you to invest in things that can allow you to become financially free. </dd></br>
        <dt><u>Other (Additional Expenses): </u></dt>
        <dd>As mentioned before, with all moeny spending, each person should first prioritize what they need, and make the contrast to what they want. If you are too focused on spending money on what you want, that could lead to a lot of debt, and keep you in a loop hole trying to pay off that debt. With this category, if you are trying to save money, try to limit what you are spending with this, and make sure you are financially secure before purchasing any thing that you don't necessarily need.</dd></br>
